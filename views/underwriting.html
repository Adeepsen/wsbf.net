<hr>
<div class="items-container">
	<p>Underwriting is an FCC-approved form of sponsorship for broadcasting which is undertaken by non-commercial, educational FM radio stations, such as WSBF-FM. This sponsorship allows an underwriter to contribute resources to be utilized by the station for support of broadcast activities. In return, the radio station is able to provide name recognition and acknowledgement of the underwriter’s contributions and sponsorship.</p> 
	<p>The following rates apply to an underwriting that is 30 seconds in length, which can include the name of the underwriter, a non-qualitative description of the service or products they provide, their location, their website, their contact information, and a company slogan. In order to include a slogan, it must be one that has consistently been used in identifying the company, it cannot contain qualitative language (such as "Always Low Prices"), and it cannot contain a call to action (such as "Come fly with us").</p>
